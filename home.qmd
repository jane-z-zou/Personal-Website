## About Me

As a UCLA capstone major in Statistics and Data Science, I bring a robust analytical foundation to my role as a Data Scientist at PwC. My work at Jules Stein Eye Institute involves applying data science methodologies to ophthalmological research, further enriching my expertise in healthcare analytics.

My experience extends to managing high-stakes projects with American Express, CourseKata, American Bar Association, and Play2Prevent Lab from the Yale School of Medicine and competing in a Google-sponsored Kaggle competition, where I honed my skills in predictive analytics and team leadership. I also leverage advanced machine learning techniques to deliver actionable insights for our DataResolution clients, enhancing their strategic outcomes for their businesses.

Outside of professional settings, I enjoy reading, walking with my mom, and crocheting. Attached is my current [CV](/DOCS/CV.pdf "CV") and [Resum√©](/DOCS/Zou,Jane%20Resume.pdf "Zou,Jane Resume").
