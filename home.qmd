## About Me

As a student at UCLA pursuing a capstone major in Statistics and Data Science, I possess a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data interpretation. I am one of nineteen nationwide Products and Technology Intern at PwC, where I applying my data analytics and business skills to a real-world pro bono consulting project.

Through machine learning techniques, I provide insightful recommendations to our DataResolution clients. Additionally, I have project management experience through my work with American Express and a Google-sponsored Kaggle competition.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy reading, walking with my family, and journaling to reflect.
