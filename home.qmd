## About Me

As a student at UCLA pursuing a capstone major in Statistics and Data Science, I possess a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data interpretation. I am a Data Scientist at PwC, where I applying my data analytics and business skills to real-world consulting projects. Attached is my current [CV](/DOCS/CV.pdf "CV") and [Resum√©](/DOCS/Zou,Jane Resume.pdf "Zou,Jane Resume").

Through machine learning techniques, I provide insightful recommendations to our DataResolution clients. Additionally, I have project management experience through my work with American Express and a Google-sponsored Kaggle competition.

Outside of the office, I enjoy reading, walking with my mom, and crocheting.
