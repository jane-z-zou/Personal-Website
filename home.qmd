## About Me

I'm Jane, a data scientist at PwC specializing in machine learning and generative AI for specialized tax sercices. I also have experience in ophthalmological data science research. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science.

My goal is to apply my robust background in data science towards uncovering impactful patterns and insights, leveraging advanced technical skills to address complex challenges and drive measurable outcomes as a data scientist. Outside of professional settings, I enjoy reading, walking with my mom, and crocheting. Discover more about me in my current [CV](/DOCS/CV.pdf "CV") and [Resum√©](/DOCS/Zou,Jane Resume.pdf "Zou,Jane Resume").
